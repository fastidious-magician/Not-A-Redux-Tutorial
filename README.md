## Redux Template

Redux tutorials suck, this is not a tutorial. This is an commented implementation.



#### Multiple Stores

Most sources will tell you not to use multiple stores with Redux. This is pure bullshit. Maybe if you're building
a toaster, you only need a single store. I don't often work on toasters. 

I've seen the following against multiple stores:
* "When it become slow nobody wants to split it into separate applications with separate stores. Nobody wants to 
spend money on refactoring." - Giant stores are bad and should never get this point when separated properly.
* "It's not debugging friendly" - Redux makes debugging enjoyable.
